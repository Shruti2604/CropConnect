### Overview
CropConnect is a direct-to-customer, e-commerce platform for farmers. By removing middlemen, CropConnect enables farmers to directly connect with buyers, maximizing profit and reducing food cost. Developed for a Hackathon hosted by GFG, Google, and AMD, CropConnect seeks to empower farmers, promote self-reliance, and teach farming skills both online and offline.

### Problem Statement
In traditional farming markets, farmers often lose income to intermediaries and struggle with debt due to limited direct sales options. CropConnect aims to resolve this by simplifying the farm-to-customer sales process and minimizing spoilage, surplus, and inflated pricing due to unnecessary logistics.
